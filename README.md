## About Me

Hello! I'm Taha Hammody, a 24-year-old from Buaina village. I recently completed my studies in Information Systems at the University of Haifa, specializing in IS Development.

In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym and engaging in sports like football and long runs. I'm also a FIFA addict. :)

Feel free to connect with me or check out my work!
